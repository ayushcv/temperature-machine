# Getting Help

## General Help and Discussions

For general discussions and help, head over to [temperature-machine on Gitter](https://gitter.im/temperature-machine/).

This should be your first port of call if you're not sure what's going on or need help getting things running. 


## Issues

If you think you've found a bug or would like to suggest a new feature, you can do so on Github via the project's [issue page](https://github.com/tobyweston/temperature-machine/issues).

Please don't cross post general questions (more suited to Gitter) to the Issue list. Issues are for bugs or feature requests. General setup and support should be directed to Gitter.

Feel free to raise an issue or even better fork the code and have a go yourself.


## Twitter

Twitter is kind of terrible for support but you can reach out to me directly at [@jamanifin](https://twitter.com/jamanifin). If you like the project and want to help promote it, any tweets or posts would be much appreciated.
